# Abstract

Abstract is a Layer 2 (L2) network built on top of Ethereum, designed to securely power consumer-facing blockchain applications at scale with low fees and fast transaction speeds.

- `abstract` is the mainnet chain available in the @/config/chain.ts file
- `abstractTestnet` is the testnet chain available in the @/config/chain.ts file

Abstract Global Wallet (AGW) is a cross-application smart contract wallet that users can create to interact with any application built on Abstract, powered by native account abstraction.

Our application uses Abstract for the blockchain and Abstract Global Wallet (AGW) for the wallet.

For any information you need clarification on, you have access to the "Abstract" MCP server to search the Abstract documentation for any information you need.

AGW is integrated into our application via the hooks from `@abstract-foundation/agw-react` and utilities from the `@abstract-foundation/agw-client` packages.

If we run into issues related to "must be called within a wagmi provider", it likely means the user has not properly wrapped their application in the `AGWProvider` component, which is the 2nd step in the installation process (it includes the `WagmiProvider` and `QueryClientProvider`).


## Wagmi, Viem, and ZKsync

Viem documentation specific to Abstract is available at https://viem.sh/zksync/

The AGW libraries work seamlessly with Viem and Wagmi, and all of the hooks and functions will work with the `abstract` and `abstractTestnet` chains using the connected Abstract Global Wallet.

You should consider, in the following order, when building out on-chain functionality:

1. Is there an Abstract Global Wallet library hook for this that can be used from the `@abstract-foundation/agw-react` package? (If you are not sure, search the Abstract MCP server).
2. Is there a function available from the `@abstract-foundation/agw-client` package that can be used to interact with the blockchain? (If you are not sure, search the Abstract MCP server).
3. Is there built-in hooks in Wagmi that can accomplish this? Abstract Global Wallet is compatible with all Wagmi hooks such as `useAccount()`, `useBalance()`, `useContractRead()`, `useContractWrite()`, `useSendTransaction()`, `useSignMessage()`, `useSignTransaction()`, `useSignTypedData()`, `useSwitchChain()`, `useWaitForTransactionReceipt()`, etc.
4. Can we use the Viem clients installed in @/config/viem-clients.ts to accomplish this?
